### Project Objective
The objective of AutoGlide is to automate the adjustable dampening of traditional coilovers. This is achieved by controlling the dampening knob on the damper of a coilover using a series of stepper motors controlled by a dash-mounted device that the driver can interact with while driving. This allows for easy and instantaneous control of the stiffness of the ride and eliminates the need to adjust the coilovers from under the hood and in the trunk of the car. Autoglide also adapts to the road conditions to provide a comfortable and accommodating ride similar to "how‚Äù premium vehicles use adaptive suspension systems from the factory.
